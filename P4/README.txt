All the test files are not running correctly.
p1: Parser exception, expected colon token
p2, p3, p4, p5: Parser exception, expected integer X1
p6: Parser exception, expected colon token IFF
p7, p8, p9, p10, s1, s2, s3: Parser exception, expected integer X 1

Overall the problem I face with this project is my parser does not implement
succesfully. Therefore all the test files throwing the parse exception. I ran
out of time to get help from Professor. I turn it in hopefully to get the
partial credit. When all the test files not pass, there is no target file 
generated, but I implemented it. 

NOTE: to compile my project:
make 
./comp   //with the input from keyboard input
./comp < input    //where input is the input test files.
